# Progress

## What Works
- **Employee Listing:** Displays employee information from the database.
- **Add Employee:** Form for adding new employees, now includes hour rate input and calculates SSS, Pag-IBIG, PhilHealth deductions automatically.
- **Delete Employee:** Functionality to delete one or multiple employees.
- **Login/Logout:** Basic authentication system.

## What's Left to Build
- **Database Schema Update:** Crucial step to add `hour_rate`, `sss_deduction`, `pagibig_deduction`, and `philhealth_deduction` columns to the `employee_info` table.
- **Display Calculated Deductions:** Update `dashboard.php` and `payslip.php` to display the newly added `hour_rate` and calculated deduction amounts.
- **Edit Employee Functionality:** Modify `edit.php` to allow editing of the `hour_rate` and ensure deductions are recalculated/displayed correctly.
- **Payslip Generation:** Enhance `payslip.php` to use the new payroll data for comprehensive payslip generation.
- **Backup/Export:** Verify `backup.php` and `export.php` handle the new data correctly.

## Current Status
The core functionalities for adding and deleting employees are in place, with recent enhancements to the 'add' feature. The system is awaiting database schema updates to fully support the new payroll calculations.

## Known Issues
- Database schema not yet updated for new columns, which will cause `add.php` to fail on insertion.
- Display and edit functionalities for new payroll data are not yet implemented.
